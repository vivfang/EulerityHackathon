# Welcome to the Eulerity Hackathon!

We’re looking for a Java intern, and are interested in finding someone that is able to iterate quickly and come up with novel solutions. To that end, we’ve devised this Hackathon to provide you an opportunity to show us your skills and score an internship with our well-funded startup.

## Requirements
 1. You must be a full time student
 1. Your code must be written in Java
 1. Bring a laptop and charger (power strips will be provided)
 1. Create a github account
 1. While not required for the hackathon, things may go more smoothly if you have Maven and Eclipse installed (also install Maven plugins for Eclipse)
 
## Problem
Given a URL that points to a business’s website, return a URL pointing to the business’s logo.

Please note that there are some 3rd party APIs that provide this functionality, however we’re interested in seeing the various strategies you’ll use to craft your custom solution.

## Some hints to get you started:
 1. From Eclipse, choose File:Import:Projects from Git:Clone URI
 1. From command line, navigate to the directory where you imported the project and type 'mvn package'. That will build a binary jar and a source jar in a directory called 'target'
 1. Open Graph meta tags may provide useful information
 1. Jsoup is a great HTML parsing library


## Your submission
 1. An executable jar file with source
 1. We will run "java -jar /path/to/your/file.jar /path/to/input.txt" and compare your results.
