# Welcome to the Eulerity Hackathon!

We’re looking for a Java intern, and are interested in finding someone that is able to iterate quickly and come up with novel solutions. To that end, we’ve devised this Hackathon to provide you an opportunity to show us your skills and score an internship with our exciting startup.

## Problem
Given a URL that points to a business’s website, return a URL pointing to the business’s logo.

## Requirements
 1. You must be a full time student
 1. Your code must be written in Java
 1. While you may use external APIs, they can not provide a direct solution to the problem. (e.g. an API that takes a url and returns a logo is not allowed)

## Getting started:
 1. From Eclipse, choose File:Import:Projects from Git:Clone URI
 1. From command line, navigate to the directory where you imported the project and type 'mvn package'. That will build a binary jar and a source jar in a directory called 'target'
 1. Run "java -jar /path/to/your/file.jar /path/to/input.txt" to generate the results file (which will be of the format /path/to/input.txt_timestamp_output.html)
 1. Open the resulting HTML file from your web browser.
 
## Hints
 1. Jsoup is a great HTML parsing library
 1. Open Graph meta tags may provide useful information
 1. If you wish to access any external APIs and need API keys, ping joe@eulerity.com

## Your submission
 1. An executable jar file with source
 1. Send an [email](mailto://joe@eulerity.com?subject=HackathonSubmission) with your jar attached.
 1. For a submission to be counted, it must be received before the open discussion of solutions.
 1. All submissions will become the property of Eulerity.
