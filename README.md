# Welcome to the Eulerity Hackathon!

We’re looking for a Java intern, and are interested in finding someone that is able to iterate quickly and come up with novel solutions. To that end, we’ve devised this Hackathon to provide you an opportunity to show us your skills and score an internship with our well-funded startup.

## Problem
Given a URL that points to a business’s website (or Facebook or Yelp page), return a URL pointing to the business’s logo.

Please note that there are some 3rd party APIs that provide this functionality (such as clearbit), however we’re interested in seeing the various strategies you’ll use to craft your custom solution.

## Some hints to get you started:
1.Open Graph meta tags may provide useful information
1.Yelp and Facebook pages often contain references to business websites
1.Jsoup is a great HTML parsing library
