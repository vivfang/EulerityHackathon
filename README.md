# Welcome to the Eulerity Hackathon!

We’re looking for a Java intern, and are interested in finding someone that is able to iterate quickly and come up with novel solutions. To that end, we’ve devised this Hackathon to provide you an opportunity to show us your skills and score an internship with our well-funded startup.

## Requirements
 1. You must be a full time student
 1. Your code must be written in Java
 1. Bring a laptop and charger (power strips will be provided)
 
## Problem
Given a URL that points to a business’s website, return a URL pointing to the business’s logo.

Please note that there are some 3rd party APIs that provide this functionality, however we’re interested in seeing the various strategies you’ll use to craft your custom solution.

## Your solution
 1. A jar file (with source attached)

## Some hints to get you started:
 1. Open Graph meta tags may provide useful information
 1. Jsoup is a great HTML parsing library
